# Installing and Running Ansible

We will look at a few topics to introduce you to Ansible; these topics will familiarize you with the basics of what Ansible is and give you a few different use cases.

## Installing and running Ansible

Let's dive straight in and install Ansible. Throughout this book, I will assume you are running a macOS host machine or a Linux machine with an Ubuntu LTS release. While we will cover running Ansible on Windows 11 using the Linux subsystem for Windows, this book will not support using Windows as a host machine.

### Installing on macOS

You can install Ansible on your macOS host machine in a few different ways. I will cover both here. As we are discussing two different ways of installing Ansible, I recommend reading through this section and the *Pros and cons* subsection before choosing which installation method to use on your local machine.

#### Installing with Homebrew

The first installation method is to use a package manager called **Homebrew**.

> ***Note***
>
> Homebrew is a package manager of macOS. It can be used to install command-line tools and desktop packages. It describes itself as “The missing package manager for macOS”, and it usually is one of the first tools I install after a clean installation or when getting a new computer.

To install Ansible using Homebrew, you first need to install Homebrew. To do this, run the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

At each step of the installation process, the installer will tell you exactly what it is going to do and also prompt you for any additional information it needs from you to complete the installation.

Once installed, or if you already have Homebrew installed, run the following commands to update your list of packages; if there are any updates, then you can also upgrade them:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade
```

Finally, depending on how new your installation is or when you last used it, you might want to run the following command to check that your Homebrew installation is optimal:

```sh
brew doctor
```

Now that we have Homebrew installed, updated, and ready to brew, we can run the following to check what Ansible packages Homebrew has by running:

```sh
brew search ansible
```

As you can see from the results in the following screenshot, there are several packages returned in the search:

Figure 1.3 – Searching for Ansible using the brew command

We want the Ansible package; you can find out more about the package by running the following command:

```sh
brew info ansible
```

You can see the results of the command in the following screenshot:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_4.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.4 – Viewing information on the Ansible package we will install

As you can see, the command returns information on the version of the package that will be installed along with a complete list of its dependencies; in the preceding screen, all of the dependencies have green ticks next to them because I already have them installed—yours may look different.

It also gives the URL to the Homebrew formula, which will be used to install the package. In our case, you can view formula details at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ansible.rb.

To install Ansible using Homebrew, we must run the following command:

```sh
brew install ansible
```

This will download and install all dependencies and then the Ansible package itself.

Depending on how many dependencies are installed on your machine, this may take a few minutes.

Once installed, you should see something like the following screenshot:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_5.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.5 – Installing Ansible using Homebrew

As you can see from the preceding screenshot, Homebrew is quite verbose in its output, giving you both feedback on what it is doing and details on how to use the packages it installs.

The second of two installation methods we will look at for macOS is a more traditional one.

#### Installing using pip

The second method, pip, is a more traditional approach to installing and configuring a Python package.

> ***Note***
>
> `pip` is a package manager for Python software. It is a recursive acronym for **pip install packages**. It is a good frontend for installing packages from the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**.

Most modern macOS installations come with pip installed by default; depending on what you have installed on your machine, you may have to check which pip binary you have installed.

To do this, run the following commands:

```sh
pip --version
pip3 --version
```

One or both should return a version number and give you the path to the pip binary.

Depending on the version of pip you have installed, you may need to amend the following pip command, which is what we need to run to install Ansible:

```sh
pip install ansible
```

This command will download and install all the prerequisites to run Ansible on your system. While it is as verbose as Homebrew, its output contains information on what it has done rather than hints on what to do next:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_6.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.6 – Installing Ansible using Pip

As you can see from the small amount of output, many of the requirements were already satisfied.

#### Pros and cons

So, now that we have covered some of the different ways of installing Ansible on macOS, which is best? Well, there is no real answer to this as it comes down to personal preference. Both methods will install the latest versions of Ansible. However, Homebrew tends to be a week or two behind the current release.

If you have a lot of packages already installed using Homebrew, then you will be used to running the following commands:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade
```

Just run these occasionally to update your installed packages to the latest versions. If you already do this, it makes sense to use Homebrew to manage your Ansible installation.

If you are not a Homebrew user and want to ensure that you immediately have the latest version installed, use the pip command to install Ansible. Upgrading to the latest version of Ansible is as simple as running the following command:

```sh
pip install ansible --upgrade
```

Should you need to, you can install older versions of Ansible using Homebrew and pip.

To do this using Homebrew, you need to remove the current version by running the following command:

```sh
brew uninstall ansible
```

Then, you can install an earlier version of the package by running the following command:

```sh
brew install ansible@2.0
```

While this will install an earlier version, you do not have much choice in which version you get. If you really need an exact version, you can use the pip command to install it. For example, to install Ansible 2.3.1.0, you would need to run:

```sh
pip install ansible==2.3.1.0
```

It is essential to note that you should never need to do this, and I do not recommend it.

However, I have found that on rare occasions, I have had to downgrade to help debug quirks in my playbooks introduced by upgrading to a later version of Ansible for playbooks that I last touched a few years ago.

As mentioned, I spend the bulk of my time in front of a macOS machine both during my day job and at home, so which of the two methods do I use?

Primarily, I use Homebrew as I have several other tools installed using Homebrew. However, if I need to roll back to a previous version, I use pip and then return to Homebrew once the issue is resolved.

### Installing on Linux

There are a few different ways of installing Ansible on Ubuntu. However, I am only going to cover one of them here. While there are packages available for Ubuntu that you can install with apt, they tend to become out of date quickly and are typically behind the current release.

If you wish to install using the `apt` package manager, then you can run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install ansible
```

> ***Note***
>
> **Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)** is the package manager that ships with Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu. It is used to manage `.deb` files.

Because of this, we will be using pip. The first thing to do is install pip, and this can be done by running the following commands:

```sh
sudo -H apt-get update
sudo -H apt-get install python3-pip
```

The first of the two `apt-get` commands downloads all the update files, ensuring that the package list is up to date on your Ubuntu installation, and the second command installs the `python3-pip` package and its dependencies.

Once pip is installed, the instruction for installing Ansible is similar to installing on macOS. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo -H pip install ansible
```

This will download and then install Ansible and its requirements, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_7.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.7 – Installing Ansible using pip on Ubuntu

Once installed, you can upgrade it by using the following command:

```sh
sudo -H pip install ansible --upgrade
```

Also, downgrading Ansible uses the same command:

```sh
sudo -H pip install ansible==2.3.1.0
```

The preceding commands should work on most Linux distributions, such as Rocky Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, and Linux Mint, to name a few.

A lot of these distributions have their own package managers you can also use to install Ansible; for example, on Red Hat-based distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Rocky Linux, you could also run:

```sh
sudo dnf install ansible-core
```

Please consult the document for more details on installing whatever your Linux distribution of choice is.

### Installing on Windows 11

The last platform we will cover is Windows 11; well, sort of. While it is technically possible to run Ansible on a Windows 11 natively, it is not something I would recommend attempting as it is one of those tasks where the phrase “*just because you can doesn't mean you should*” applies, as getting all of the dependencies installed and configured just right can be very troublesome, and maintaining them is more so.

Luckily, Microsoft—and as a long-term Linux System administrator typing this, this still feels strange—has excellent native support for running Linux systems seamlessly within Windows 11.

Open the Microsoft Store and search for Ubuntu; you should see something like the following screen:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_8.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.8 – Finding Ubuntu in the Microsoft Store

Click the Get button to download Ubuntu. Once downloaded, we have Ubuntu on our Windows 11 host, but we still need something to run it on. To run it, we need to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux.

To enable this, open a PowerShell window by typing PowerShell into your Windows Search bar and opening the Windows PowerShell application; once you are at a terminal prompt, run the following command:

```sh
wsl --install
```

Follow the onscreen prompts, and once everything is installed, restart your Windows 11 host.

Once rebooted, you should have something like the following prompt pop-up once you log back in:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_9.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.9 – Completing the Ubuntu installation on Windows 11

Once the installation is completed, I like to switch out of the default Windows Subsystem for the Linux terminal and use the Microsoft Terminal, which you can grab for free in the Microsoft Store.

Once you have your preferred terminal emulator open and you are sitting at a prompt in your Windows Subsystem for Linux Ubuntu installation, you can run the same commands we ran to install Ansible on Linux, which are as follows:

```sh
sudo -H apt-get update
sudo -H apt-get install python3-pip
sudo -H pip install ansible
```

Once you have run these commands, you should see an output that looks like the following screenshot:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_10.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.10 – Installing Ansible in Ubuntu on Windows 11

As you can see, everything works as if you were running an Ubuntu machine, allowing you to run and maintain your Ansible installation in precisely the same way.

> ***Note***
>
> The **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** is not running on a virtual machine. It is a full native Linux experience baked right into Windows 11. It targets developers who must run Linux tools as part of their toolchain. While the overall support for Linux commands is excellent, I recommend reading through the FAQs written and maintained by Microsoft to get an idea of the limits and quirks of the subsystem. The FAQ can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq.

As mentioned, while this is a viable way of running an Ansible control node on a Windows-based machine, some of the other tools we will cover in future chapters may not work with Windows. So, while you may follow along using the Ubuntu instructions, some parts may not work.

---

## Launching a virtual machine

To launch a virtual machine to run our first set of Ansible commands against, we will use a tool called Multipass. This tool allows you to run Ubuntu virtual machines on your local host. It works with macOS, Linux, and Windows.

To install Multipass on macOS, we can use Homebrew and run the following command:

```sh
sudo brew install multipass
```

To install on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

```sh
sudo snap install multipass
```

Finally, for Windows 11 users, you will have to first download and install the VirtualBox Windows executable from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and then download and install Multipass from https://multipass.run/install. I recommend reading through the installation notes for Windows, which can be found at the following URL https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-windows before installing.

> ***Note***
>
> While you can run the same commands in Ubuntu running under Windows Subsystem for Linux, you will need to replace all references of the `multipass` command with `multipass.exe` so that the Windows version of Multipass is called.

Next, check out the GitHub repo accompanying this title and open your terminal in the Chapter01 folder—if you are running Windows 11, you must open an Ubuntu terminal, not a Windows one.

> ***Important***
>
> Before we start, a quick word of warning: the folder `Chapter01` contains an OpenSSH key-pair, which will be used to access the local machine. It is important that you do not use this key-pair anywhere other than this example on your local machine as the key-pair is publicly accessible, which is not considered secure.

You will see several files in the `Chapter01` folder. The one we are going to use when launching the virtual machine is called **cloud-init.yaml**. This file contains some back configuration to add a user called `vmadmin` and attach the public portion of an OpenSSH key to the user, meaning that when executing Ansible, we can use the private part of the OpenSSH key to authenticate as the vmadmin user.

The command we are going to run to launch the virtual machine, which will be called ansiblevm, is as follows:

```sh
multipass launch -n ansiblevm --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml
```

Once the virtual machine has been launched, which may take a short while when you first run the command as it will download a virtual machine image, you need to run the following command to get some information on the newly created ansiblevm virtual machine:

```sh
multipass info ansiblevm
```

The following screen shows me starting and viewing the information on the virtual machine:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_11.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.11 – Launching our virtual machine

Now that we have our virtual machine running and we have checked out the basic information, you will need to note the IP address, which in my case is 192.168.64.7. The IP address will be different when you launch the virtual machine on your host.

Before we run our first Ansible playbook, you must make a copy of the `hosts-simple.example` and `hosts.example` files and remove the `.example` in the filename by running the following commands:

```sh
cp -pr hosts-simple.example hosts-simple
cp -pr hosts.example hosts
```

Once you have made a copy of the file, open the newly created files and replace just the text that says `paste_your_ip_here` with the IP address of the `ansiblevm` virtual machine; in my case, the `hosts-simple` file went from:

```sh
paste_your_ip_here.nip.io ansible_user=vmadmin ansible_private_key_file=./example_key
```

to reading:

```sh
192.168.64.7.nip.io ansible_user=vmadmin ansible_private_key_file=./example_key
```

Once you have changed both the hosts-simple and hosts files, you are ready to run your first Ansible Playbook.

---

## An introduction to playbooks

Typically, in IT, a **playbook** is a set of instructions run by someone when something happens; a little vague, I know, but stay with me. These range from building and configuring new server instances to deploying code updates and dealing with problems when they occur.

In the traditional sense, a playbook is typically a collection of scripts or instructions for a user to follow, and while they are meant to introduce consistency and conformity across systems, even with the best intentions, this is seldom the case.

This is where Ansible comes in. Using an Ansible playbook, you are telling it to apply these changes and commands against these sets of hosts rather than having to log in and start working your way through the playbook manually.

Before we run a playbook, let's discuss how we provide Ansible with a list of hosts to target. To do this, we will be using the `ansible.builtin.setup` module. This connects to a host and then fetches as much information on the host as possible.

### Host inventories

To provide a list of hosts, we need to provide an inventory list. This is in the form of a host's file.

In its simplest form, our host's file could contain a single line just like our `hosts-simple` file:

```log
192.168.64.7.nip.io ansible_user=vmadmin ansible_private_key_file=./example_key
```

This tells Ansible that the host we want to contact is `192.168.64.7.nip.io` (please remember your IP address will be different) using the username `vmadmin`. If we didn't provide the username, it would fall back to the user you are logged into your Ansible control host as, which in my case is the user `russ`, which does not exist on the `ansiblevm` we launched. The final part tells Ansible to use the private OpenSSH key file called `example_key`, which we installed the public portion of to the `vmadmin` user when we launched the virtual machine.

> ***Note***
>
> We are using https://nip.io, a free service that provides free wildcard DNS entries for any hostname containing an IP address. This means that our domain `192.168.64.7.nip.io` will resolve to `192.168.64.7` when a DNS lookup is made against the domain.

To run the `ansible.builtin.setup` module, we need to run the following command from within the `Chapter01` folder where your updated `hosts-simple` and `example_key` files are stored, making sure to update the IP address to your own:

```sh
ansible -i hosts-simple 192.168.64.7.nip.io -m ansible.builtin.setup
```

If everything works as expected, you should see a lot of output, which specifies some quite detailed and low-level information about your host. You should see something like the following:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_12.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.12 – The start of the output of me running the ansible.builtin.setup module

As you can see from the preceding screenshot, Ansible has quickly found out a lot of information on our Vagrant box. The screenshot shows the IP addresses configured on the machine, along with the IPv6 addresses. It has recorded the time and date, and if you scroll through your output, you will see a lot of information returned detailing the host.

Let's go back to the command we ran:

```sh
ansible -i hosts-simple 192.168.64.7.nip.io -m ansible.builtin.setup
```

As you can see, we are loading the `hosts-simple` file using the -i flag. We could have also used `--inventory=hosts-simple`, which loads our inventory file. The next part of the command is the host to the target. In our case, this is `192.168.50.4.nip.io`. The final part of the command, `-m`, tells Ansible to use the setup module. We could have also used `--module-name= ansible.builtin.setup`.

This means that the full command if we didn't use shorthand would be:

```sh
ansible --inventory=hosts-simple simple 192.168.64.7.nip.io --module-name=ansible.builtin.setup
```

As already mentioned, the `hosts-simple` file is as basic as we can get it. The following is a more common host inventory file:

```ini
ansiblevm ansible_host=192.168.64.7.nip.io

[ansible_hosts]
ansiblevm

[ansible_hosts:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
ansible_user=vmadmin
ansible_private_key_file=./example_key
host_key_checking=False
```

This is the content of the file called just `hosts`; as you can see, there is a lot more going on, so let's quickly work through it from top to bottom.

The first line defines our single host. Unlike the simple example, we will be calling our target host `ansiblevm` and grouping it together in a group called `ansible_hosts`, so we are giving Ansible details of where it can SSH to. This means we can now use the name `ansiblevm` when referring to `192.168.64.7.nip.io`. This means our command would now look something like this:

```sh
ansible -i hosts ansiblevm -m ansible.builtin.setup
```

Next up in the file, we are creating a group of hosts called `ansible_hosts` and, in that group, we are adding our single host `ansiblevm`. This means that we can also run:

```sh
ansible -i hosts ansible_hosts -m ansible.builtin.setup
```

If we had more than just a single host in the group, the preceding command would have looped through all of them. The final section of the `hosts` file sets up some common configuration options for all of the hosts in the boxes group. In this case, we are telling Ansible that all of the hosts in the group are using SSH, the user is `vmadmin`, the private key at `./example_key` should be used, and it should not check the host key when connecting.

We will be revisiting the inventory host files in later chapters. From now on, we will use the `hosts` file to target the `ansible_hosts` group.

### Playbooks

In the previous section, running the `ansible` command allowed us to call a single module.

In this section, we are going to look at calling several modules. The following playbook is called **playbook01.yml**. It calls the `ansible.builtin.setup` module we called in the previous section and then uses the `ansible.builtin.debug` module to print a message to the screen:

```yml
---
- name: "A simple playbook"
  hosts: ansible_hosts
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  become_method: "ansible.builtin.sudo"
  tasks:
    - name: "Output some information on our host"
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "I am connecting to {{ ansible_nodename }} which is running {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"
```

Before we break the configuration down, let's look at the results of running the playbook. To do this, use the following command:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook01.yml
```

This will connect to our host, gather information on the system, and then return just the information we want in a message:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_13.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.13 – The output of running ansible-playbook01.yml

The first thing you will notice about the playbook is that it is written in YAML, a recursive acronym for YAML Ain't Markup Language. YAML was designed to be a human-readable data serialization standard that all programming languages can use. It is commonly used to help define configurations.

The indentation is very important in YAML as it is used to nest and define areas of the file. Let's look at our playbook in more detail:

```sh
---
```

While these lines might not seem like much, they are used as document separators, as Ansible compiles all the YAML files into a single file. It is essential for Ansible to know where one document ends and another begins.

Next up, we have the configuration for the playbook. As you can see, this is where the indentation starts to come into play:

```yml
- name: "A simple playbook"
  hosts: ansible_hosts
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  become_method: "ansible.builtin.sudo"
```

The - tells Ansible that this is the start of a section. From there, key-value pairs are used. These are as follows:

> * `name`: This gives a name to the playbook run.
> * `hosts`: This tells Ansible the host or host group to target in the playbook. This must be defined in a host inventory like the ones we covered in the previous section.
> * `gather_facts`: This tells Ansible to run the `ansible.builtin.setup` module when it first connects to the host. This information is then available to the playbook during the run.
> * `become`: This is present because we are connecting to our host as a basic user, in this case, the **vmadmin** user. Ansible may not have enough access privileges to execute some of the commands we are telling it to, so this instructs Ansible to execute all of its commands as the root user.
> * `become_method`: This tells Ansible how to become the root user; in our case, we have a passwordless sudo configured by the `cloud-init` script we ran when launching the virtual machine, so we are using `ansible.builtin.sudo`.
tasks: These are the tasks we can tell Ansible to run when connected to the target host.

You will notice that from here, we move the indentation across again. This defines another section of the configuration. This time it is for the tasks:

```sh
    - name: "Output some information on our host"
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "I am connecting to {{ ansible_nodename }} which is running {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"
```

As we have already seen, the only task we run is the `ansible.builtin.debug` module. This module allows us to display output in the Ansible playbook run stream you saw when we ran the playbook.

You may have already noticed that the information between the curly brackets is made up of the keys from the `ansible.builtin.setup` module. Here, we are telling Ansible to substitute the value of each key wherever we use the key. We will be using this a lot in our playbooks. We will also be defining our own key values to use as part of our playbook runs.

Let's extend our playbook by adding another task. The following can be found as **playbook02.yml**:

```yml
---
- name: "Update all packages"
  hosts: "ansible_hosts"
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  become_method: "ansible.builtin.sudo"
  tasks:
    - name: "Output some information on our host"
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "I am connecting to {{ ansible_nodename }} which is running {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"
    - name: "Update all packages to the latest version"
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: "*"
        state: "latest"
        update_cache: true
```

As you can see, we have added a second task that calls the `ansible.builtin.apt` module. This module is designed to help us interact with the package manager used by Ubuntu and other Debian-based operating systems called `apt`. We are setting three key values here:

> * `name`: This is a wildcard. It tells Ansible to use all of the installed packages rather than just a single named package. For example, we could have used something such as `apache2` here to target Apache.
> * `state`: Here, we are telling Ansible to ensure the package we have defined in the name key is the `latest` version. As we have named all of the installed packages, this will update everything we have installed.
> * `update_cache`: As the virtual machine image we downloaded was optimized for being small, it does not contain any information on the available package; by setting `update_cache` to `true`, this will download a list of all package and version information.

Run the playbook using the following command:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook02.yml
```

This will give us the following results:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_14.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.14 – The output of running ansible-playbook02.yml

The `ansible.builtin.apt` task has been marked as changed on the host box. This means that packages were updated.

Rerunning the same command shows the following results:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835088913/graphics/image/B21620_01_15.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.15 – The output of rerunning ansible-playbook02.yml

As you can see, the `ansible.builtin.apt` task is now showing as `ok` on our host. This is because there are currently no longer any packages requiring updates.

Before we finish this quick look at playbooks, let's do something more interesting.

The playbook, `playbook03.yml`, adds NTP installing, configuring, and starting capabilities to our virtual machine. It also uses a template to add a custom NTP config file to our virtual machine.

The `vars` section allows us to configure our own key-value pairs. In this case, we are providing a list of NTP servers, which we will be using later in the playbook:

```yml
  vars:
    ntp_servers:
      - "0.uk.pool.ntp.org"
      - "1.uk.pool.ntp.org"
      - "2.uk.pool.ntp.org"
      - "3.uk.pool.ntp.org"
```

We are actually providing four different values for the same key. These will be used in the template task. We could have also written this as follows:

```yml
  vars:
    ntp_servers: [ "0.uk.pool.ntp.org", "1. uk.pool.ntp.org", "2. uk.pool.ntp.org", "3. uk.pool.ntp.org" ]
```

However, this is a little more difficult to read. The next new section is `handlers`. A **handler** is a task that is assigned a name and called at the end of a playbook run depending on what tasks have changed:

```yml
  handlers:
    - name: "Restart ntp"
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: "ntp"
        state: "restarted"
```

In our case, the restart `ntp` handler uses the `ansible.builtin.service` module to restart `ntp`. Next up, we have two new tasks, starting with installing the NTP service and the `sntp` and `ntp-doc` packages using `ansible.builtin.apt`:

```yml
    - name: "Install packages"
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        state: "present"
        pkg:
          - "ntp"
          - "sntp"
          - "ntp-doc"
```

As we need to install three packages, we need a way to provide three different package names to the `ansible.builtin.apt` module so that we don't have to have three different tasks for each of the package installations. To achieve this, we use the `pkg` option rather than the `name` option, where you can only define a single package to install. Rather than using `latest`, we are using `present`; this will mean that our packages don't get updated if they are already installed.

The final addition to the playbook is the following task:

```yml
    - name: "Configure NTP"
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: "./ntp.conf.j2"
        dest: "/etc/ntp.conf"
        mode: "0644"
      notify: "Restart ntp"
```

This task uses the `ansible.builtin.template` module. To read a template file from our Ansible controller, process it and upload the processed template to the host machine. Once uploaded, we are telling Ansible to notify the `restart ntp` handler if there have been any changes to the configuration file we are uploading.

In this case, the template file is the `ntp.conf.j2` file in the same folder as the playbooks, as defined in the `src` option. This file looks like this:

```log
# {{ ansible_managed }}
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift
restrict default nomodify notrap nopeer noquery
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1
{% for item in ntp_servers %}
server {{ item }} iburst
{% endfor %}
includefile /etc/ntp/crypto/pw
keys /etc/ntp/keys
disable monitor
```
\
The bulk of the file is the standard NTP configuration file, with the addition of a few Ansible parts. The first addition is the very first line:

```log
# {{ ansible_managed }}
```

If this line wasn't there every time we ran Ansible, the file would be uploaded, which would count as a change and the restart ntp handler would be called, meaning that even if there were no changes, NTP would be restarted.

The next part loops through the `ntp_servers` values we defined in the `vars` section of the playbook:

```sh
{% for item in ntp_servers %}
server {{ item }} iburst
{% endfor %}
```

For each of the values, add a line that contains the word `server`, the value or `{{ item }}`, and then `iburst`.

Now that we know what we have added to the playbook and have an idea of the additional tasks that will be performed, let's run it using the following command:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook03.yml
```

The following screen just shows the additional tasks and not the full output as we know it will be just marked as ok:

This time, we have three changed tasks. Running the playbook again shows the following:

Figure 1.17 – The output of rerunning ansible-playbook03.yml

As expected, there are no changes because we haven't changed the playbook or anything on the virtual machine, and Ansible is reporting everything as ok. Also, because no changes were detected to the NTP config file, the Handler to restart NTP did not need to be called, and therefore it doesn't appear in the output.

Before we finish, let's launch a second virtual machine by running the following command:

```sh
multipass launch -n ansiblevm2 --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml
```

Once the second virtual machine has started, run the following command to get some information on the new virtual machine:

```sh
multipass info ansiblevm2
```

Now that we know the IP address, we can add two new lines to our `hosts` file. First of all, to define the new host, add the following code (updating it so it uses the correct IP address) underneath where our original host is defined:

```sh
ansiblevm2 ansible_host=192.168.64.8.nip.io
```

Then, add `ansiblevm2` to the `ansible_hosts` group:

```ini
[ansible_hosts]
ansiblevm
ansiblevm2
```

Then, rerun the playbook using the following:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook03.yml
```

As you can see, the same commands run, but now we are targeting both virtual machines, the original virtual machine has no changes, and all the changes are applied to the newly deployed host:

Figure 1.18 – The output of rerunning ansible-playbook03.yml against two virtual machines

If you rerun the command, you will see that everything is now shown as `ok` as there are no further changes.

Before we move on to the summary, let's tidy up our two virtual machines and remove them as we won't need them again. To do this, run the following command:

```sh
multipass delete --purge ansiblevm ansiblevm2
```

As I am sure you would have already guessed, this deletes the virtual machines and then purges the configuration and files.

## Summary

In this chapter, we have taken our first steps with Ansible by installing it locally and then, using Vagrant, launching a virtual machine to interact with. We learned about basic host inventory files and used the Ansible command to execute a single task against our virtual machine.

We then looked at playbooks, starting with a basic playbook that returned some information on our target before progressing to a playbook that updates all the installed operating system packages before installing and configuring the NTP service.

By the end of the chapter, we had launched a second virtual machine and quickly brought it up to the same configuration level as our first virtual machine.

In the next chapter, we will look at Ansible Galaxy and discuss how Ansible packages up and maintains its community modules.
