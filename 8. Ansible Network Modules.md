## Ansible Network Modules

---

## Manufacturer and device support

So far, we have been looking at modules that interact with servers. In our case, they have mostly been running locally. In the upcoming chapters, we will be communicating more with remotely cloud-hosted servers. But, before interacting with remote servers, we should cover the core network modules.

These modules have all been designed to interact with and manage the configuration of various network devices, from your traditional top-of-rack switches and fully virtualized network infrastructure to firewalls and load balancers. Ansible supports many devices, from open source virtual appliances to hardware solutions, some of which could have a starting price of over USD 500,000, depending on your configuration.

So, what do all these collections and modules have in common?

Well, they all interact with what are traditionally complex to configure devices, which, in most deployments and environments, are both the core and critical elements; after all, everything connected to them needs some level of network connectivity.

These modules give you a standard interface, i.e., Ansible, for many of these devices and remove the need for engineers to access these devices directly. They can, instead, run Ansible playbooks, which run roles created by experienced network engineers to configure them in a controlled and consistent way by just changing a few variables.

The only downside of using Ansible to manage this critical core infrastructure is that the host running Ansible requires a line of sight to the management interface or API running on the devices, which may sometimes raise some security concerns. Hence, Ansible’s instructions on how to manage your network devices need some serious thought.

### The collections

The following list of collections is in the order of the namespaces and then the collection name; this is listed at the end of each item as **[namespace.collection-name]**.

#### Apstra Extensible Operating System (EOS) [arista.eos]

There are over 30 modules that allow you to manage your devices running EOS. These modules let you operate **access control lists (ACLs)** interfaces, configure **border gateway protocol (BGP)** settings, run arbitrary commands on devices, manage hostname, interface configurations, logging, and more. A module also allows you to gather facts from each device.

Additionally, there are plugins for command line and HTTP API interactions.

#### Check Point [check_point.mgmt]

The Ansible collection for Check Point Management comprises many modules; at the time of writing, there are over 250 modules.

Each manages different aspects of your Check Point device, such as access layers, rules, administrators, or network feeds on your Check Point firewall using the Web Services API. They provide functionalities ranging from fetching facts and adding or managing objects to workflow features such as approving and publishing sessions on your Check Point firewall.

#### Cisco

Given the number of Cisco device types and classes, there are several collections in the Cisco namespace.

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) [cisco.aci]
The 150+ ACI modules are used to manage all aspects of Cisco’s ACI, which is to be expected of Cisco’s next-generation API-driven networking stack.

There are modules for managing various aspects of the Cisco ACI, such as AAAA records (these are address records that store IPv6 addresses), roles, users, certificates, Access SPAN configurations, bridge domains (BDs) and subnets, BGP route reflectors, and many more. There are modules for managing Cloud Application Profiles and Cloud AWS Provider configurations.

## Summary

I suspect most of you would not have heard of a lot of the devices we have listed in this chapter, and for the ones you have heard of—such as the Cisco ones—you will probably not have had direct access to them, leaving any configuration to your network administrators.

When we speak about triggering Ansible using CI/CD in Chapter 15, *Using Ansible with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps*, and Chapter 16, *Introducing Ansible AWX and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*, we will learn about some deployment options that could help alleviate the concerns we mentioned at the start of the chapter, e.g., those about a host running your Ansible playbooks needing a line of sight of the potentially critical core infrastructure.

Before we get to those chapters, we will look at moving our workloads to the cloud, a journey that starts in the next chapter.
